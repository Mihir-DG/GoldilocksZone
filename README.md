# GoldilocksZone
A Python implementation of my 0d approach to the Goldilocks zone in habitability.

The central idea of the Goldilocks Zone is to narrow down a range of radii around a given star, such that the surface temperature of a planetary body within this range supports liquid water, and thus, possibly support life. For this to hold, the temperature would have to be at an optimal level where it's "not too hot, and not too cold" - hence, the "Goldilocks" Zone, as in the porridge from the popular children's story of the same name.
